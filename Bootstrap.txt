<div class="container">
- this class enable website to adjust according to width of screen using using media query

Inside the container 
<div class="row">
-Each row inside a container is divided in 12 equal sized columns.	
There are five different sub classes:
- Default
- sm for small
- md for medium
- lg for large, and
- xl for extra large screen sizes

For defining number of col and there sizes
it is defined -> .col - *
eg. <div class="col-sm-5">
This specify all the content in this div will constitute of the five columns and will be compaitable with all the screen sizes from small to extra large.
<div class="col-sm-7"> -> if we specify this tha the contents of this div will be side be side with the above div.

*We also have options for auto-layout columns 
eg. <div class="col-sm"> <div class="col-sm"> <div class="col-sm"> this will distribute the 12 cols uniformly
eg. <div="col-sm"> <div class="col-sm-6"> <div class="col-sm"> this will work too in the obvious manner.

<div class="col-12 col-sm-5"> <div class="col-12 col-sm-5">
for extra small screens this will be stacked one upon other

*Reordering content
<div class="col-sm-5 order-sm-first">
<div class="col-12 col-sm-5 order-sm-last">
This can order the div.
<div class="container fluid">

*Vertical Alignments
<div class="row align-items-center">
It align all the contents in a div vertically aligned to center.

<div class="row justify-conr=tent-center">
<div class="col-3"> <div class="col-auto"> <div class="col-3">	-> here auto will not allow middle div to take all the cols present, it will take no. of col depending on its content. There might be a chance that some cols might remain unused.	

<div class="col-sm-4 offset-sm-1"> this specifies from sm to xl this div should be right shifted by col, i.e. one col will remain blank before this div. Only 7 cols are remaining for use as this div uses 5 cols indirectly

*Nesting of col
